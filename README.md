# Contact-Management-Application-in-JavaFX
Welcome to my first JavaFX program! This project is a contact management application that allows you to add, edit, and delete contacts. Each contact includes a first name, last name, image, and a list of email addresses. Below is a brief overview of the current functionality and some ideas for future enhancements. If you have any tips or suggestions, I'd love to hear them!

## Current Features:
Add Contacts: Enter a first name, last name, email addresses, and select an image to create a new contact.
Edit Contacts: Modify existing contact details including first name, last name, emails, and image.
Delete Contacts: Remove a contact from the list.
Email Validation: Ensures email addresses are valid using a regex pattern.

## Feedback and Contributions:
This is my first JavaFX program, and I'm open to all the tips and advice you might have. Feel free to fork the repository, make improvements, and submit pull requests. Your feedback is highly appreciated!
